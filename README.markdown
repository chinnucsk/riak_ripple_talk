## Riak and Ripple, yet another NoSQL solution

This is my slides and some demo code for a talk I gave on Riak and the Ruby
client Ripple. The focus was to introduce some of the cool features of Riak,
that I believe set it apart from the pack, and to show how to use Riak from
Ruby.

The slides were produced using
[deck.js](https://github.com/imakewebthings/deck.js) and the
[deck.js-codemirror](https://github.com/iros/deck.js-codemirror) extension for
syntax highlighting.

Much of the technical details were researched on Basho's website, which is a
fantastic resource, but any mistakes are all my own.
