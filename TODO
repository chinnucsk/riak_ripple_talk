- read riak wiki on concepts and map reduce example

BUGS:
- ripple wiki example for "Basic Riak::Client example"

"application/javascript"

No serializer has been registered for content type "application/javascript" (NotImplementedError)

- ripple example introduces a flawed MapReduce example, no definition of JSON data.

List Keys:
curl -v http://127.0.0.1:8098/buckets/books/keys?keys=true

Delete Key:

curl -v -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:8098/riak/books/key

NOTES:

Basho focuses on solid engineering and no hype. They are known to point customers to other products if they don't fit Riaks model. Clean code.

Buckets might be compared to tables or folders in relational databases or file systems, respectively.

How existing RDBMS systems are organised?

Contrast to Riak, where there is only objects.

Clustering, talk to a single node which co-ordinates read/writes on your behalf.

Default buckets are essentially free and unlimited, non-default requires gossiping of the details.

Riak runs map-step functions right on the node holding the input data for those functions, and it runs reduce-step functions on the node coordinating the MapReduce query.

Ripple, doesn't support the full text search API.
